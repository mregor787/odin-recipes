        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>12 slices bacon</li>
            <li>⅔ cup butter or margarine</li>
            <li>⅔ cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>7 cups milk</li>
            <li>4 large baked potatoes, peeled and cubed</li>
            <li>4 green onions, chopped</li>
            <li>1 ¼ cups shredded Cheddar cheese</li>
            <li>1 cup sour cream</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Place bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, 
                until evenly browned, about 8 to 10 minutes. Drain bacon slices on paper towels; 
                crumble and set aside. 
            </li>
            <li>
                Meanwhile, melt butter in a stockpot or Dutch oven over medium heat.
                Gradually add flour, whisking until well-combined. Slowly pour in milk, 
                whisking constantly until smooth and thickened. 
            </li>
            <li>
                Add potatoes and onions and bring to a boil, stirring frequently. 
                Reduce heat and simmer for 10 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                Stir in crumbled bacon, Cheddar cheese, sour cream, salt, and pepper.
                Continue cooking and stirring until cheese is melted. 
            </li>
