            <ul>
                <li>12 slices bacon</li>
                <li>⅔ cup butter or margarine</li>
                <li>⅔ cup all-purpose flour</li>
                <li>7 cups milk</li>
                <li>4 large baked potatoes, peeled and cubed</li>
                <li>4 green onions, chopped</li>
                <li>1 ¼ cups shredded Cheddar cheese</li>
                <li>1 cup sour cream</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>

            <h2 class="recipe-second-title">Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Place bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, 
                    until evenly browned, about 8 to 10 minutes. Drain bacon slices on paper towels; 
                    crumble and set aside. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    Meanwhile, melt butter in a stockpot or Dutch oven over medium heat.
                    Gradually add flour, whisking until well-combined. Slowly pour in milk, 
                    whisking constantly until smooth and thickened. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    Add potatoes and onions and bring to a boil, stirring frequently. 
                    Reduce heat and simmer for 10 minutes.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Stir in crumbled bacon, Cheddar cheese, sour cream, salt, and pepper.
                    Continue cooking and stirring until cheese is melted. 
                </li>
