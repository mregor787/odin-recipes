                    <p class="recipe-par">The best potatoes for French fries are soaked in a sugar solution before frying.</p>
                    <p class="recipe-par">
                        The sugar solution has something to do with the carbohydrates and prevents the potatoes 
                        from soaking up a lot of grease, so they get crunchy.
