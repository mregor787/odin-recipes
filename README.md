# Odin Recipes Project
## Description
This is my first so-called "project" going through TOP curriculum. As for now,
it seems not as pretty as it might be: index page doesn't even have an image,
all paragraphs & headings are in standard font, no positioning for content, etc.
## To-Do List
As I'll be going through further lessons of TOP, I'll eventually get an opportunity
to return to this project and do some improvement for my recipes.
- Choose much more appropriate fonts for text content
- Add more images & other attractive media to the index page
- Make a menu (navigation bar) for convenience of movement
- Add some animations using CSS/JS
- ...and so on...
